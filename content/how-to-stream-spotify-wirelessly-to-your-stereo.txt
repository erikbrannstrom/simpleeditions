How to stream Spotify wirelessly to your stereo
=================================================

The best and most simple solution to listen to Spotify in your stereo is by 
connecting your computer to your stereo using a regular stereo cable. But if you
have a laptop and want to use it from different locations, that method obviously 
fails. Not to mention that stereo cables tend to get glitchy when used for some time.

So, the second best alternative is to connect a separate computer to your stereo and
from this computer do the audio playback. You can then connect this computer to a TV
and get a [wireless keyboard and mouse] to remote control it.

But if you absolutely must use your laptop to wirelessly stream music to your stereo,
here are five solutions, ranging from the best to the trickiest. Which is best to you,
however, depends on your setup and equipment.

## Solution A: Stream to an AirPort Express

The simplest thing to do when it comes to wireless streaming is to purchase an 
[Apple AirPort Express] ($99) from which you drag an audio cable to your stereo. On top of 
helping your sound system, the AirPort Express gives you wireless printer and home 
network router.

The AirPort Express was built to function natively with iTunes, but there's a program
for Mac and PC called 'AirFoil' ($25, test it 10 min a time) which allows you to 
the sound of a program (e.g Spotify) and broadcast it to an AirPort Express. 

This method works well for streaming from a computer. Note well, however, that AirFoil
doesn't work with anything but a PC or a Mac, so streaming from your iPhone or another
Spotify mobile phone *won't* work with the AirPort Express. (This may change if Spotify
ever implements native AirPort Express support, in which case AirFoil won't be needed).

Requirements:
- Apple Airport Express 
- AirFoil 
- A PC or Mac

## Solution B: Stream to a Bluetooth receiver
## Solution C: Stream to your mobile phone
## Solution D: Stream to another computer (AirFoil)
## Solution E: Stream to your PS3/Xbox
