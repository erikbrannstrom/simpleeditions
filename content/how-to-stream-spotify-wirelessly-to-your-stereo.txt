How to stream Spotify wirelessly to your stereo
=================================================

The best and most simple solution to listen to Spotify in your stereo is by 
connecting your computer to your stereo using a regular stereo cable. But if you
have a laptop and want to use it from different locations, that method obviously 
fails. Not to mention that stereo cables tend to get glitchy when used for some time.

So, the second best alternative is to connect a separate computer to your stereo and
from this computer do the audio playback. You can then connect this computer to a TV
and get a [wireless keyboard and mouse] to remote control it.

But if you absolutely must use your laptop to wirelessly stream music to your stereo,
here are five solutions, ranging from the best to the trickiest. Which is best to you,
however, depends on your setup and equipment.

## Solution A: Stream to an AirPort Express

The simplest thing to do when it comes to wireless streaming is to purchase an 
[Apple AirPort Express] ($99) from which you drag an audio cable to your stereo. On top of 
helping your sound system, the AirPort Express gives you wireless printer and home 
network router.

The AirPort Express was built to function natively with iTunes, but there's a program
for Mac and PC called 'AirFoil' ($25, test it 10 min a time) which allows you to 
the sound of a program (e.g Spotify) and broadcast it to an AirPort Express. 

This method works well for streaming from a computer. Note well, however, that AirFoil
doesn't work with anything but a PC or a Mac, so streaming from your iPhone or another
Spotify mobile phone *won't* work with the AirPort Express. (This may change if Spotify
ever implements native AirPort Express support, in which case AirFoil won't be needed).

Requirements:
- Apple Airport Express 
- AirFoil 
- A PC or Mac

## Solution B: Stream to a Bluetooth receiver

Another alternative that should be fairly straightforward is to get yourself a Bluetooth
receiver. This receiver can then be connected straight to your stereo, much like the 
AirPort Express. 

Bluetooth is good because it's a wireless protocol supported by quite a high number of 
devices, including computer, laptops and phones. There are even some newer stereos that
have Bluetooth built into them and can receive wireless audio out of the box.

In either case, the only setup required is to plug in the Bluetooth receiver close to 
your stereo and jack the audio cable into it. From the computer you're streaming, open
up the Bluetooth panel and search for the device and attempt to pair with.

Examples of Bluetooth devices: 
- 1
- 2
- 3

## Solution C: Stream to your computer or iPhone using AirFoil speakers

The [previously discussed] streaming program [AirFoil] can, on to of streaming audio,
also receive it. It has an application called _AirFoil speakers_ which acts as a 
receiver device much like the Airport Express. 

AirFoil speakers is available for Windows, Mac and iPhone. Let one of these device be
connected to the stereo and run the application AirFoil speakers. From the computer 
you wish to be streaming audio, start the regular AirFoil application and see if the 
computer/phone you set up for receiving can be found. If it can, connect to it and
start playing!

## Solution D: Stream to your PS3/Xbox
