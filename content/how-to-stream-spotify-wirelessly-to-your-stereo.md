How to stream Spotify wirelessly to your stereo 
=================================================

The best and most simple solution to listen to Spotify without cables is by 
connecting your computer to your stereo using a regular audio cable. 

But if your computer is not stationary, before fiddling with wirless streaming
we'd recommend you to connect a separate, stationary computer (if you have one) to your 
stereo and from this computer do the audio playback. You could even plug it into your 
TV and get a wireless keyboard and mouse to remote control it.

But if you absolutely must use your laptop to wirelessly stream music to your stereo,
here are five solutions, ranging from the best to the trickiest. Which is best to you,
however, depends on your setup and equipment.

## Solution A: Stream to an AirPort Express

The simplest thing to do when it comes to wireless streaming is to purchase an 
[Apple AirPort Express] ($99). It's a little WiFi router that you can plug in your stereo and 
printer to which become available to all computer in that wireless network.

The AirPort Express was built to function natively with the music program iTunes, but there's 
a program called 'AirFoil' ($25, 10 minutes free trial per day, Mac/PC only) which allows you 
to capture the sound of a program (e.g Spotify) and send it wirelessly to an AirPort Express 
in which your stereo is connected. Voila!

This method works well for streaming from a PC or Mac, but not from an iPhone or another
Spotify mobile phone.

Requirements:
- Apple Airport Express 
- AirFoil 
- A PC or Mac

## Solution B: Stream to a Bluetooth receiver

If you get yourself a device called a Bluetooth (A2DP) receiver, you should be able to wirelessly 
send music to this device and let it forward it through an audio cable straight to your stereo, 
much like the AirPort Express.

Bluetooth is good because it's a wireless method supported by quite a high number of 
devices, including computers, laptops and phones, so most likely you already have what you need
in terms of sending capabilities - you just need the receiver. There are even some newer stereos 
that have Bluetooth receivers built into them.

In either case, the only setup required is to plug in the Bluetooth receiver close to your stereo 
and jack the audio cable into it. From the computer you're streaming, open up the Bluetooth panel 
and search for the device and attempt to pair with. Detailed instructions on how to pair with the 
Bluetooth receiver is hopefully included in its manual.

## Solution C: Stream to your computer or iPhone using AirFoil speakers

The [previously discussed] streaming program [AirFoil] can, on to of streaming audio, also receive 
audio. It has an application called _AirFoil speakers_ which acts as a receiver device much like 
the Airport Express. 

AirFoil speakers is available for Windows, Mac and iPhone. Let one of these device be
connected to the stereo and run the application _AirFoil speakers_ on it. From the computer 
you wish to be streaming audio, start the regular AirFoil application and see if the 
computer/phone you set up for receiving can be found. If it can, connect to it and
start the disco!

## Solution D: Stream to your PS3/Xbox

Another solution, a bit less smooth, is to stream Spotify to your gaming console. At
this time, PS3 and Xbox both support something called DLNA, a protocol for sharing 
music files and playing them. This isn't supported by Spotify, but you can set up a 
program to capture the sound from Spotify and make your gaming console believe it's a
music file on your computer - a very, very long track, containing whatever you currently 
play in Spotify.

For Windows, there's a program called [JamCast] ($29.99, 14 days trial) which lets you
do just that. It has a feature called 'Virtual Soundcard' that will capture *all* sound
that your computer plays, and broadcast it. 

Simply download and install JamCast and enable the Virtual Soundcard playback. Go to 
your gaming console and search for Media servers, and see if your computer shows up. 
If it does, access it and go to playlists -> Virtual Soundcard and play it.

If you have any lag or playback problems, make sure your connection to your wireless
router is good, and that your gaming console is using a wired (rather than wireless)
connection, since the lag normally has to do with the speed of your wireless 
connection.

In our experience, this solution works but takes a little fiddling before it's 
optimal, not to mention it takes at least 10-20 seconds from the time you start the 
playback on the gaming console until it actually plays. But if it floats your boat,
then we're happy.
