# SimpleEditions

SimpleEditions is a crowdsourced tutorial web site being developed in Python for [Google App Engine](http://appengine.google.com/). The site is available at <http://www.simpleeditions.com/>.

## Running the site locally

First of all, you will need to have the [Google App Engine SDK](http://code.google.com/appengine/) installed.

After cloning this repository, you will need to copy `src/simpleeditions/settings.py.template` to `src/simpleeditions/settings.py`. Once this has been done, launch the Google App Engine development server and browse to the local address (<http://localhost/> by default).
